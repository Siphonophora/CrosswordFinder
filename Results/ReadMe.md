# Result Data

These are organized by puzzle size and by 'slice' of the order 1 puzzle space or 'All' if the data is stored together. 

Files are serilog output from the run written as JSON. The log has summary statistics and example puzzles which are produced, along with total puzzle counts found. When compiling sliced results, skipped slices are duplicated across the brances. Also, the 'blank' puzzle isn't included in the final result is the total from all the slices, plus 1.
