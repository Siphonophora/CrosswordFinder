There are ten 7x7 grids without cheaters. These can be seen drawn in the figure from Laurent Lessard [on 538](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/time-for-some-abstract-math-drink-up/) or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/LaurentLessard/status/1086688328173391874). They are the puzzles without black squares in the corners (they are all in the last four rows). 

Both running the full search, or searching by slices finds 9 puzzles. Adding the blank puzzle gets the expected result of 10.
